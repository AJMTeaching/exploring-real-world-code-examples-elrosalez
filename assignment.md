# Assignment: Exploring Real-World Code Examples
## Introduction
In our everyday lives, we interact with a myriad of software applications, often without realizing the complex code that powers them. From the moment we silence our morning alarm, to checking the weather forecast, or even making an online purchase, software is an integral part of our daily routine. As we embark on our journey to learn coding, it's essential to understand how these applications are built and function. This assignment, designed for beginners, leverages our newly acquired skills in using GitHub and other online repositories. It's an opportunity to explore and connect with the real-world applications of code.

## Objective
Your task is to delve into the world of coding by finding real-life examples of code that power the software applications you use daily. This exercise will help you understand how theoretical coding concepts are applied in practical, real-world scenarios.

## Assignment Details
Research and Exploration: Using online repositories like GitHub, search for code examples that align with the everyday software applications described in the provided prose blurbs.

Link and Line Numbers: For each example, provide the link to the code repository and specify the exact line numbers where the relevant code is located. This will help you practice navigating through code repositories and understanding code structure.

Documentation: Along with each link, write a brief description of what the code does and how it relates to the functionality of the application in the real world.

## Prose Blurbs for Exploration
- Code that specifies when an alarm clock should start making audible sounds.
- Code for a rocket targeting system.
- File compression utility algorithm.
- Weather forecasting algorithm.
- E-commerce checkout system process.
- Social media post scheduler.
- Fitness app calorie counter.
- Online voting system mechanics.
- Automated email response system.

## Submission Format

Document Title: "Exploring Code in Daily Life"
Content Structure: For each of the nine blurbs, include a heading with the blurb title, followed by your findings (link and line numbers) and a brief description. Also, do the same for 3 kinds of tools you use every day (for example: how the email app knows there are new messages, how my calendar adds new items, how my video game authenticates my user/password)
Length: No more than two paragraphs per blurb.
Evaluation Criteria
Accuracy: Correctly identifying relevant sections of code.
Clarity: Clear and concise descriptions of how the code functions.
Research Skills: Ability to effectively use online resources like GitHub.





Code that specifies when an alarm clock should start making audible sounds
https://github.com/Jabromen/Python-Alarm-Clock/blob/master/alarm_clock.py
Lines 37-45 allow for the user to input the time at which the alarm will sound. It also continuously checks the current time against the time at which it must sound. Line 71 is what actually produces the sound. Although these are some important lines the entire code is continuously working to make sure the alarm clock makes sound in time. 

Code for rocket targeting system 
https://github.com/GuidodiPasquo/AeroVECTOR/tree/master
Lines 150-178 involve calculations for trajectory corrections based on various flight dynamics and environmental factors. This part of the script is fundamental to targeting a system of a rocket. The script calulates how the rocket needs to adjust its path to reach its target correctly. This script is a great example of physics in coding. 

File compression utility algorithm
https://github.com/adriraj2000/File-Compression-Utility
Lines 35-67 contain the main function for compressing files. This script focuses on lossless data compression. This script provides a practical application of algorithmic principles in real-world software. Understanding how Huffman Coding works and seeing it implemented in Python can be incredibly beneficial. Huffman places the most frequent characters closer to the root, minimizing the length of other characters. 

weather forecast algortithm
https://github.com/Naman-Bhalla/Weather_Forecasting_Sliding_Window_Algorithm
Lines 26-45 are critical for implementing the sliding window algorithm which predicts temperature trends. The script begins by loading weather data and then utilizes another coding technique to calculate the average temperature. This script is practical for showing how data can be used to predict future weather conditions. 

E-commerce checkout system process
https://github.com/Tcomester/Raya-e-commerce-System
lines 32-58 are significant in this script as they show how the code manages the checkout process. The script initially checks the items in the cart for validity and then proceeds to calculate the total price as well as processing payment. Upon payment processing the script finalizes the order and sends a confirmation to the user. 

Social media post scheduler
https://github.com/Visualistic-Studios/Media-Manager
Lines 45-72 are important in this script as it manages the scheduling and posting of media. This script is designed to automate the scheduling and posting of media to different platforms. The script allows post specification as well as manages a queue of posts. 

Fitness app calorie counter
https://github.com/anuragts/Fitness-app
Lines 25-50 handle the computation of the calories burned based on the users activeness. The script collects the data from the user such as physical activity performed and biometric information. A predefined equation is found in the code to allow for this computation. 

Online voting system mechanics.
https://github.com/shah-deep/Online-Voting-System
Lines 58-80 handle the core functionality of voting and ensure its validity. The script allows for users to vote electronically. Once vote is submitted the script conducts a validity test before counting all the votes that have been recieved. This script highlights the implementation of script reliability in the electronic voting system. 

Automated email response system.
https://github.com/thekamik/email-automation-with-gpt-ai-and-python
Lines 35-65 implement the mechanism for reading incoming emails and generating automatic responses through ai. This script is an example of how ai can be integrated into software tools to generate automated responses. The script itself is what sends out the email. 

adding to calendar 
https://github.com/cheveedodd/Google-Calendar---Add
Lines 30-55 are incharrge of creating new events and adding them to a google calendar. This is a task that is done very often so this script enhances what is behind our so called simple task. The script prompts the user to input event infot and then provides feedback confirming that it has been added. 

sending an email newsletter
https://github.com/emencia/emencia-django-newsletter
lines 45-75 handle the core function of preparing and sending newsletters to a list of subscribers. These lines of code setip and prepare the email content then it interacts with the list of who is going to recieve it. 

2048 game 
https://github.com/yangshun/2048-python
Lines 50-75 handle the logic of the game such as the movements of merging tiles. These lines of code manage the users input to move tiles left, right, up ot down. The script also contains win conditions. This script is a prime example of how code is used in simpole games that we may play randomly.
